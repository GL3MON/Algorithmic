# Algorithmic
_A Multi-Agent System designed to tackle complex coding challenges requiring high-level reasoning._


## Tools

- 🐳 Docker: _used for safe execution of python code in sandboxes environment_
- 🦜🕸️Langgraph: _creating a control flow for multi-agent system and handling system states_
- 🦜Langchain: _used for handling role prompts and setting up LLMs_
- 🏵️Gradio: _used for creating a front-end to interact witht the agents_


## Features

- Mathematical Analysis: _It provides detailed insights to help solve complex problems._
- Error Fixing: _Automatically identifies and fixes errors in generated code._
- Test Case Handling: _Efficiently generates code to manage various test cases._
- High Reasoning Capabilites: _Handles Hard leveled Questions with low acceptance rate._

## Deployment

To deploy this project follow the below steps :

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py
```
